Public Projects
=================
This is a repository of mini projects that I think more people might find useful. You are free to clone them as you see fit.

## Excel CtoI
 
This C program converts the provided spreadsheet column letter(s) (up to ZZ) into integers. This can be really useful if you work with poorly-formatted data like I do, or just data in general.

## Runpace
 
This C program calculates minutes/mile pace from [HH:MM:SS] and [Miles]. Might add support for other things later, but so far this is all I need.
